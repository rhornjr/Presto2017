Instead of having to enter my CodePlex TFS credentials every time I loaded this solution, I did this:

On Windows 7 (and vista?) you can stop TFS prompting for passwords all the time by adding in a windows credential in Control Panel -> User Accounts -> User Accounts -> Manage your credentials.

Add a windows credential for your tfs server.
